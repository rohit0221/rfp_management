| "Our pricing is fixed."                             | Propose a longer-term contract (e.g., 3 years) in exchange for a discount on the monthly base price. Highlight the stability that a longer contract provides. |
| "We can't change SLAs."                             | Request enhanced SLAs with specific performance metrics and introduce penalty clauses for non-compliance. Emphasize the importance of service reliability in our operations. |
| "Implementation costs are mandatory."               | Counter by requesting complimentary implementation services if committing to a multi-year agreement. Stress that this will allow us to allocate budget more efficiently. |
| "No flexibility in contract lock-in."                | Push for shorter initial commitment periods (e.g., 6-12 months) with the option to extend based on performance and satisfaction. This reduces risk for both parties and encourages adaptive collaboration. |
| "Our pricing model is competitive."                  | Leverage competitive pricing data from our analysis to request a further reduction, particularly for high-volume usage. Mention that this will enhance our partnership and potentially lead to increased usage. |
| "We require a minimum subscription period."          | Suggest a tiered subscription model that allows for scalability based on usage. Offer to provide forecasts that demonstrate our commitment to using their services extensively. |
| "We cannot accommodate volume discounts."            | Propose a sliding scale for discounts based on usage thresholds. Emphasize the potential for increased business as we expand, positioning it as a win-win scenario. |
| "Support services are at standard rates."            | Negotiate for enhanced support tiers at no extra cost, especially during the initial implementation phase. Highlight the importance of seamless onboarding for long-term partnership success. |
| "Our compliance features are fixed."                  | Request customizable compliance features that align with our specific regulatory needs. Offer to share insights on compliance trends that could benefit their service offerings. |
| "Our response times are already optimized."           | Propose performance-based incentives for faster response times, especially for critical issues. Stress how this could lead to mutual benefits in terms of efficiency and customer satisfaction. |
