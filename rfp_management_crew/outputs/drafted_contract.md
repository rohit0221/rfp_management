**HIGHLIGHTED DEVIATIONS FOR LEGAL REVIEW:**
1. **Price**: Agreed upon price is lower than Supplier A’s offer but higher than Supplier C’s.
2. **Delivery Time**: Commitment to 1 week is faster than Supplier A’s and Supplier C’s timelines.
3. **Contract Terms**: Trial period proposed is less binding than Supplier A's fixed-term, ensuring flexibility.
4. **Payment Terms**: Payment term aligns with Supplier B’s net-30 days policy, differing from Supplier A’s 50% upfront requirement.
5. **Warranty**: 2-year warranty offered is better than Supplier A's 1-year but needs to be contrasted with Supplier C's absence of warranty.
6. **SLA**: Guaranteed 99% uptime provides less assurance compared to Supplier A's 99.9%, which needs evaluation.
