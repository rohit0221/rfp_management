# üìÑ Contract Review Report

## üîç Key Deviations Identified
- **1. Pricing & Payment Terms:** The contract states a base price of $18,000/month for Cloud Storage, which deviates from the previously negotiated price of $20,000/month. The Compute Instances pricing is also inconsistent with the negotiation documents, which suggested $45/instance instead of $40/instance.
- **2. Service Level Agreements (SLAs):** The uptime guarantees for Compute Instances and AI-Powered Analytics are lower than expected, with 99.95% and 99.9% respectively, whereas the negotiation documents indicated higher expectations.
- **3. Exit Clause:** The buyout fee of 3 months' service charges is not aligned with the negotiation charter, which suggested more flexible terms.
- **4. Compliance Clauses:** While GDPR, SOC2, and ISO 27001 are mentioned, PCI-DSS compliance is not explicitly stated as required.
- **5. Dispute Resolution:** The arbitration clause lacks clarity on the governing law, which should be explicitly stated.

## üõ† Recommended Corrections
- **1.** Adjust the base pricing for Cloud Storage to $20,000/month and Compute Instances to $45/instance to align with the negotiated terms.
- **2.** Raise the uptime guarantees for Compute Instances to 99.99% and for AI-Powered Analytics to 99.95% to meet the expectations set during negotiations.
- **3.** Revise the early termination clause to eliminate the buyout fee or reduce it significantly to reflect a more flexible approach.
- **4.** Include explicit mention of PCI-DSS compliance in the compliance section to ensure full regulatory adherence.
- **5.** Clarify the governing law in the dispute resolution section to avoid ambiguity.
