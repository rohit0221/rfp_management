# üìÑ Contract Review Report

## üîç Key Deviations Identified
- 1. **Pricing & Payment Terms**: The contract states a base price of $18,000/month for Cloud Storage, which is inconsistent with the negotiation documents indicating a $25,000/month base price for CloudTech Solutions.
- 2. **Service Level Agreements (SLAs)**: The SLA for Cloud Storage has a 10-minute response time, which is not in line with the 15-minute response time agreed in the negotiation documents for critical issues.
- 3. **Compliance**: The contract mentions adherence to PCI-DSS but does not explicitly state the need for compliance with FedRAMP, which was highlighted in the negotiation documents.
- 4. **Early Termination Clause**: The buyout fee of 3 months of service charges is higher than expected based on negotiations, which aimed for a more flexible exit strategy.
- 5. **Volume Discounts**: The contract mentions a 10% discount for Cloud Storage but does not specify the threshold for usage, which needs to be defined clearly.

## üõ† Recommended Corrections
- 1. Adjust the base price for Cloud Storage to reflect the negotiated amount of $25,000/month. 
- 2. Update the SLA response time for Cloud Storage to 15 minutes to align with negotiated terms. 
- 3. Include a specific mention of FedRAMP compliance in the regulatory compliance section. 
- 4. Reassess the early termination buyout fee to a more competitive figure, ideally aligning it with industry standards or previous negotiation discussions. 
- 5. Clearly define the usage threshold for the 10% discount on Cloud Storage to ensure clarity and enforceability.
